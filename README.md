# 3-Datasets
Three datasets that I find interesting for DASC 2113. All of them were taken from Kaggle.com.

## Dog intelligence 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jasleensondhi/dog-intelligence-comparison-based-on-size 
The dataset includes breed names, heights, weights, and how many repetitions the dog needs before it understands a new command.


## Cars
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abineshkumark/carsdata
The dataset includes various metrics such as weight, engine size, cylinders, and a few others.

## Chipotle menu

The dataset includes the names of each item on the menu, serving size, and other nutrition information.
